## 🎯 Overview

**ArchFlow AI** generates system architecture diagrams from plain-English product descriptions.

Describe a platform — e.g. *"Design a hotel booking system"* — and ArchFlow AI will:

1. 🤖 **Understand** the requirements using an AI model
2. 🧩 **Generate** appropriate microservices for the domain
3. 🔗 **Connect** those services with sensible relationships
4. 📊 **Render** an interactive, explorable architecture diagram

---

## ✨ Features

**AI-Powered Generation**
- Uses `google/flan-t5-small` to interpret the described business domain
- Produces domain-specific services rather than generic templates
- Falls back to a rule-based generator if the model call fails

**Interactive Diagrams**
- Drag-and-drop node positioning
- Zoom and pan for large architectures
- Minimap overview
- Export the diagram structure as JSON

**Smart Architecture Patterns**
- Recognizes common domains: e-commerce, social media, ride-sharing, streaming, healthcare, education, and more
- Generates the right mix of services, databases, caches, queues, and storage
- Follows standard microservices conventions

**Fully Deployable, Free Tier**
- Backend on Hugging Face Spaces
- Frontend on Vercel
- Responsive UI out of the box

## 🧠 How It Works

```
User Prompt                 "Design a hotel booking system"
      │
      ▼
AI Model (flan-t5-small)    Understands the domain, drafts services
      │                     e.g. Hotel Service, Booking Service, Payment Service
      ▼
Architecture Builder        Converts AI output into nodes, edges, DBs, queues

## 🚀 Deployment

**Backend → Hugging Face Spaces**
1. Create a new Space at [huggingface.co/new-space](https://huggingface.co/new-space)
   - Type: Docker
   - Hardware: CPU Basic (free)
   - Template: Blank
2. Upload `backend/main.py`, `backend/requirements.txt`, and `backend/Dockerfile`
3. Wait for the build to finish
4. Your backend URL will be: `https://<your-username>-archflow-ai-backend.hf.space`

**Frontend → Vercel**
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the repository at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Add the environment variable:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://<your-username>-archflow-ai-backend.hf.space
   ```
4. Deploy

## 📊 Sample Prompts to Test

| Prompt | Expected Services |
|---|---|
| "Design a hotel booking system" | Hotel, Booking, Payment |
| "Design a social media app" | Post, User, Feed, Follow |
| "Design an e-commerce platform" | Product, Cart, Order, Payment |
| "Design a Netflix-like platform" | Content, Recommendation, User |
| "Design an Uber-like app" | Matching, Location, Trip, Payment |

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Model download fails on Hugging Face (`ReadTimeoutError`)**
The model is ~308MB — it can take 5–10 minutes on first load. Let the build finish.

**404 on `/health`**
Confirm `main.py` defines `@app.get("/health")`, check the Space logs, and test with `curl https://your-space.hf.space/health`.

**Frontend shows generic "Service 1, Service 2" instead of domain-specific names**
This means the backend fell back to the rule-based generator because the AI call failed. Try a more specific prompt and check the Space logs for "Model loaded!".

**405 Method Not Allowed on `/generate`**
`/generate` only accepts POST requests — use `curl -X POST` or the frontend, which already sends POST.

**`npm install` is very slow**
Usually an HDD-vs-SSD issue. Move the project to an SSD if possible, or just wait it out.

**Vercel flags a vulnerable Next.js version**
```bash
npm install next@latest
git add .
git commit -m "Update Next.js"
git push
```

**Frontend still calls localhost after deployment**
Confirm `.env.local` exists locally and that `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set in the Vercel dashboard for production, then redeploy.
